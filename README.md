# Django-User-authenticaion-and-management
Web application using Django
The application is capable of authenticating users to home if they are registered to this site. If not they are able to register as new user and login in this page.
And I added a coustom admin panel (I removed in built 'admin' app from this Porject). This admin can acces the user details and edit or delete user data.
